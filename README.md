# Indoct's BG3 Piercing Set Creator

A web app to help you easily create your own Baldur's Gate 3 piercing sets, with data and images of each piercing, both vanilla and mod.



## Instructions

In the Miscellaneous section of my mod, you can find the template file and a PDF with step-by-step instructions of how to create 'new' sets:
https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5907?tab=files

Any piercings from Mods require you to download and install the mod in question with [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), or they will not show up in the game.
